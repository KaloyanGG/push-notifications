1. To have a installable PWA, the manifest is enough.
2. To have a install prompt (IOS not supported), you need "beforeinstallprompt" event on the window and prevent its default, save the "event" and call its .prompt() method. (possible to also include screenshots in the manifest for the install prompt)
3. Service worker is for functionalities of the PWA.
